## Explication
This project was my first project at all with C#. I already did some work with Java so it wasn't to difficult. 
I decided to realise this Yahtzee UI to show an example of a beginner project and my terms of programming.
  
> The objective of **Yahtzee** is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations and dice must remain in the box. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others for which the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points, the highest of any category. ( -Wikipedia)
  
  
## UI
The UI was created with Windows-Form-App (.NET Framework).
